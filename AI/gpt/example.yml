Title: SMS Delivery Failure in Asia-Pacific Region
Severity: SEV-1
Status: Resolved
Detected At: 2025-05-20 03:12 UTC
Detected By: Alertmanager (Twilio Gateway Latency Alert)
Commander: Alex Tran

Summary:
Between 03:12 and 05:48 UTC, users in the Asia-Pacific region experienced SMS delivery failures due to a misconfigured BGP route on one of our upstream telecom partners.

Business Impact:
Approximately 15 million SMS messages were delayed or failed during peak business hours, affecting OTP delivery for banking and authentication use cases.

Root Cause:
A manual configuration update at Telecom Partner X introduced an invalid BGP advertisement, which caused packet loss between our Singapore gateway and their backbone.

- SMS Gateway
- Monitoring Service

Regions Affected:
- APAC

[Postmortem - INC-2025-0432](https://confluence.company.com/incidents/postmortems/INC-2025-0432)

Lessons Learned:
- Need automated alerting for asymmetric packet loss patterns
- Partner route announcements must be validated in staging before production push
- Escalation contact list must be centrally maintained

Follow-up Meeting:
- Scheduled for 2025-05-22 at 14:00 UTC with all stakeholders.
