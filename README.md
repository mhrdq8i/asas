# Incident Management System

## Summary

This is a web-based [**Incident Management System**](Incident.md) designed to help teams track and manage incidents effectively. It provides a _centralized platform_ for **reporting**, **tracking**, **resolving** incidents.

Conducting [**postmortems**](Postmortem.md), ensuring a **streamlined workflow**, **clear communication**, and **continuous improvement**.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern and robust technology stack:

- **Backend:** **Python** with the **Flask** _async_ framework.
- **Database:** **PostgreSQL** for reliable and relational data storage.
- **Task Queue:** **Celery** for running asynchronous background tasks.
- **Message Broker & Cache:** **Redis** to work with Celery and for caching purposes.
- **Containerization:** **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for creating a consistent development and deployment environment.
- **Frontend:** Standard **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the user interface.

## Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization:**

  - Secure user registration to create a new account.
  - **JWT-based authentication:** User login is handled via JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and stateless authentication.
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The system supports different user roles (e.g., administrator, user), with specific permissions for actions like creating, updating, and managing incidents.
  - Password hashing for enhanced security.

- **Incident Reporting:**

  - Create new incidents with a title, detailed description, and priority level.
  - Each incident is automatically assigned a unique ID and timestamp.

- **Automated Incident Creation:**

  - Define custom filters to monitor alerts from an external alert manager.
  - Automatically create a new incident in the system when an alert matches your predefined criteria for critical issues.

- **Incident Tracking and Management:**

  - A central dashboard to view all reported incidents in a clear, tabular format.
  - Each incident in the list displays its ID, title, status, priority, and creation date.
  - Ability to update the status of an incident (e.g., "Open", "In Progress", "Closed").

- **Persistent Storage:**
  - Incidents and user data are stored in a relational database, ensuring data is saved between sessions.

## Installation (with Docker)

This project is configured to run in a Docker container, which makes the setup process straightforward.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker:** You will need to have Docker installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS. On Linux, you may need to install it separately.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mhrdq8i/asas.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```sh
   cd asas/docker
   ```

3. **Build and run the containers**

   Use Docker Compose to build the images and start the services in the background:

   ```sh
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

4. **Access the application**

   Once the containers are running, you should be able to access the application in your web browser. Typically, this will be at [http://localhost:8000] or another port if specified in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

5. **Stopping the application**

   To stop the running containers, you can use the following command:

   ```sh
   docker compose down
   ```

   Got it. That's a great way to handle API documentation. Here is a new section that directs users to the FastAPI-generated docs. This can be placed after the "Usage" section.

## API Documentation

This application provides a full REST API for interacting with the incident management system programmatically.

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and is available at the following endpoints when the application is running:

- **Swagger UI:** [http://localhost:8000/docs]
- **ReDoc:** [http://localhost:5000/redoc]

These interfaces allow you to explore all available API endpoints, view their parameters, and test them directly from your browser.
